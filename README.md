Introduction

This project is a Java File Handling Utility that allows users to read, write, and modify text files through a simple console interface. File handling is a fundamental concept in programming, especially for data storage, logging, and configuration purposes.
Using this utility, users can manage file content dynamically without the need for databases. It is highly relevant for internships and beginner-level software development projects.

Objective

The primary objectives of this project are:
To learn and implement basic file operations in Java
To understand and use Java I/O streams efficiently
To handle exceptions gracefully
To create a simple user interface using the console for interaction
By completing this task, the user gains knowledge of reading, writing, and modifying files, which is a prerequisite for backend development and desktop applications.
